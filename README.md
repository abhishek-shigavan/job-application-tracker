# Job Application Tracker

Job Application Tracker is a web application that allows users to manage and track their job applications efficiently. Users can log in using their Google account, add new jobs, update job statuses through drag-and-drop between columns, and edit job details when needed. Jobs are displayed in columns based on their current status.

## Features

- **Google Authentication**
  - Users can securely log in using their Google account.
  - Firebase Authentication is used for handling sign-in and sign-out functionality.

- **Protected Routes**
  - Only authenticated users can access the dashboard and job-related pages.
  - If an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected route, they are redirected to the login page.

- **Add New Job**
  - Users can add job applications with relevant details through a modal form.
  - Newly added jobs are immediately displayed under the selected status column.

- **Drag-and-Drop for Status Management**
  - Job cards can be dragged and dropped between different status columns (e.g., Applied, Interview, Offer, Hired, Rejected).
  - This updates the jobâ€™s status in real-time in Firestore.

- **Update Job Details**
  - Users can update job information by clicking on a job card and modifying the details.
  - All updates are persisted to Firestore.

- **Real-Time Job Display**
  - Jobs are fetched from Firestore using the `jobs` collection, filtered by the currently authenticated user.
  - Jobs are categorized and displayed in different columns based on their status.
  - The UI updates in real-time as data changes in Firestore.
